# Final Degree Project
## Description
This repository contains scripts used for the project: Proteomic signatures associated with the body composition at baseline and after five years of follow-up in an adult population.
The project aimed to characterize plasma proteomic profiles associated to baseline body composition and changes in body weight in two Swedish cohorts composed of adult men and women.
To explore these associations, repeated double cross-validated models were performed coupled to random forest (rdCV-RF) and partial least squares (rdCV-PLS) algorithms. The package “MUVR” was used to perform these analyses. The MUVR function requires some specifications for arguments such as:
